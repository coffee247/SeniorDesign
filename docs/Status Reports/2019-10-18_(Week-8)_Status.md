## 3. List of Milestones to be completed and anticipated date

  * Prompt Mr. Jeter at Dupont to ["Narrow the scope"](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-CS326-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/issues/7) by defining which windows in the legacy system are NOT needed (MP)
  * Assemble, Install, and test operate "clone" balistic analysis system. 
  * 17 Oct 2019 -- BNC cables and PCIe NI6602 card delivered by Dupont to VCU due 17-Oct-2019
  * Further develop / continue work on [Statement of Work](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-MULT606-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/blob/master/Documentation/Statement_Of_Work.md) document. complete NLT 20 Sep 2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUw1K_7HPkCn8hqNF-GUn2tW1sUHFUCNhFq1kbwdjEQ/edit?usp=sharing) document. This is a living document (never completely done) (all)
  * Open and begin analysis of LABVIEW project (all)
    *  VCU team is quickly reaching the decision to completely abandon Labview and work from screenshots of the legacy BIMS system.
  * Install MySQL database, create master user and password
  * Write python connect script for database.
  * Create splash screen & Login logic.
    
## 4. List of issues, problems, or concern(s)

  * The project is still in the problem definition stage.  Too many unknowns exist to make significant progress in the development effort.  Once the "clone" system has been set up, and analyzed, the velocity of development is expected to increase substantially. 
  * Although the "clone" system was delivered by Luke Jeter (and his crew) on 07-Sep-2019, the VCU development team is still missing the 4 BNC cables necessary to operate the system.
