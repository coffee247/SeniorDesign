## 3. List of Milestones to be completed and anticipated date
  * Acquire and set up "clone" balistic analysis system at VCU. Due 11-Sep-2019 (client action required)
  * Develop "Statement of Work" document for client and VCU signature.
## 4. List of issues, problems, or concern(s)
  * The project is still in the problem definition stage.  Too many unknowns exist to make significant progress in the development effort.  Once the "clone" system has been delivered, set up, and analyzed, the velocity of development is expected to increase substantially.
