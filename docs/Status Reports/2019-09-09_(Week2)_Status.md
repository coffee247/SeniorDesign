## 3. List of Milestones to be completed and anticipated date

  * Acquired "clone" balistic analysis (HARDWARE) system for installation at VCU. completed 07-Sep-2019 (MP)
  * Assemble, Install, and test operate "clone" balistic analysis system. due 20-Sep-2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Statement of Work](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-MULT606-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/blob/master/Documentation/Statement_Of_Work.md) document. complete NLT 20 Sep 2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUw1K_7HPkCn8hqNF-GUn2tW1sUHFUCNhFq1kbwdjEQ/edit?usp=sharing) document. This is a living document (never completely done) (all)
  * Open and begin analysis of LABVIEW project 
    * Will we have to purchase a Labview license? (all)
    * Have dedicated lab computer with the license for analysis of the Legacy code?

## 4. List of issues, problems, or concern(s)

  * The project is still in the problem definition stage.  Too many unknowns exist to make significant progress in the development effort.  Once the "clone" system has been set up, and analyzed, the velocity of development is expected to increase substantially. 
  * Although the "clone" system was delivered by Luke Jeter (and his crew) on 07-Sep-2019, the VCU development team is still missing the NI-6602 card necessary to operate the system.
