---

## Date: 05 Oct 2019  (Week 6)

## 1.  Project Members

  * Micah Parks (MP)
  * John Naylor (JN)
  * James Stallings (JS)
  * All of the above team members (all)

## 2.  Accomplishments for the week -- and which team members participated/contributed

  * On 03 Oct 2019, installed Labview on computer provided by Dupont.
  * On 03 Oct 2019, met with VCU staff mentor (Dr. Dahlberg) for weekly update and coaching. (JS) (JN)

## 3. List of Milestones to be completed and anticipated date

  * Prompt Mr. Jeter at Dupont to ["Narrow the scope"](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-CS326-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/issues/7) by defining which windows in the legacy system are NOT needed (MP)
  * Assemble, Install, and test operate "clone" balistic analysis system. (Waiting of BNC cables) due 17-Oct-2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Statement of Work](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-MULT606-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/blob/master/Documentation/Statement_Of_Work.md) document. complete NLT 20 Sep 2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUw1K_7HPkCn8hqNF-GUn2tW1sUHFUCNhFq1kbwdjEQ/edit?usp=sharing) document. This is a living document (never completely done) (all)
  * Open and begin analysis of LABVIEW project (all)
    *  NI LabView is installed on all Engineering "Computer Lab" Computers in Engineering East & West.
    
## 4. List of issues, problems, or concern(s)

  * The project is still in the problem definition stage.  Too many unknowns exist to make significant progress in the development effort.  Once the "clone" system has been set up, and analyzed, the velocity of development is expected to increase substantially. 
  * Although the "clone" system was delivered by Luke Jeter (and his crew) on 07-Sep-2019, the VCU development team is still missing the 4 BNC cables necessary to operate the system.
