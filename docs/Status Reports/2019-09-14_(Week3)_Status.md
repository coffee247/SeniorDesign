## 3. List of Milestones to be completed and anticipated date

  * [Find a space](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-CS326-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/projects/1#card-26447446) in Engineering East to assemble and store the "clone" BIMS hardware.  due ASAP (all)
  * Prompt Mr. Jeter at Dupont to ["Narrow the scope"](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-CS326-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/issues/7) by defining which windows in the legacy system are NOT needed (MP)
  * Assemble, Install, and test operate "clone" balistic analysis system. due 20-Sep-2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Statement of Work](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-MULT606-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/blob/master/Documentation/Statement_Of_Work.md) document. complete NLT 20 Sep 2019 (all)
  * Further develop / continue work on [Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gUw1K_7HPkCn8hqNF-GUn2tW1sUHFUCNhFq1kbwdjEQ/edit?usp=sharing) document. This is a living document (never completely done) (all)
  * Open and begin analysis of LABVIEW project (all)
    *  NI LabView is installed on all Engineering "Computer Lab" Computers in Engineering East & West.
    *  Add new Labview install on computer in close proximity to "clone BIMS." ([Dahlberg](https://github.com/VCU-CS-Capstone/2019-CS326-DuPont-Ballistic-Data-Acquisition/projects/1?card_filter_query=assignee%3Abobdahlberg)?)

## 4. List of issues, problems, or concern(s)

  * The project is still in the problem definition stage.  Too many unknowns exist to make significant progress in the development effort.  Once the "clone" system has been set up, and analyzed, the velocity of development is expected to increase substantially. 
  * Although the "clone" system was delivered by Luke Jeter (and his crew) on 07-Sep-2019, the VCU development team is still missing the NI-6602 card necessary to operate the system.
  * All team members should read Chapter 2 of the [NI 660X Register-Level Programmer Manual](http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/370505b.pdf)
