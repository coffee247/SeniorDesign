  # Draft Statement of Work
  A team of students (VCUS) enrolled in the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Computer Science Senior Design course will develop a replacement for the Ballistic Data Acquisition System (BIMS) currently in use at the Dupont Spruance plant in Richmond Virginia.
  
 ## Requirements
 
The replacement BIMS (R-BIMS) will improve upon BIMS in the following ways:
* It will preserve desirable BIMS fuctionality
* It will solve stability issues existent in BIMS
* It will Interface with a modern database management system that:
  * is searchable, so that generated ballistic data can be examined in ways typical to data residing in modern database management systems.
  * compartmentalizes sensitive data in such a way that one database can be securely shared with many users having a variety of security clearances and access privileges.

## Documentation

* the development team will fully document the development process so that other developers might improve upon their work in the future.

* The development team will create printable user-manuals and in-application help for users of R-BIMS

  
## Assumptions

* The client will provide Portuguese language translations of all user-interface text and user-documentation within an agreed upon "reasonable" time after being prompted by the VCU development team.
